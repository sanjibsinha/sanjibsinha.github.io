    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style layout featuring a header, an introduction, a filterable prompt gallery, and a data visualization section. The core interaction is filtering the prompts by category (relationship, setting) to allow users to quickly find inspiration. Clicking on a prompt "card" opens a modal with full details, keeping the main interface clean. This structure was chosen to transform a static list into an engaging tool, allowing users to actively explore the content based on their interests rather than passively reading a long document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Prompt List -> Goal: Organize/Explore -> Presentation: Interactive Card Grid with Modals -> Interaction: Users can filter the grid and click cards to see details. Justification: Far more engaging and user-friendly than a static list. 2. Implicit Theme Data -> Goal: Inform/Analyze -> Presentation: Bar Chart (Chart.js) showing prompt counts by setting type (e.g., Indoor, Outdoor). Interaction: Hover tooltips show exact counts. Justification: Adds an analytical layer, helping users understand the overall composition of the prompt collection at a glance. Method: Chart.js/Canvas. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
