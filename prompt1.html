    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Ember -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dual-pane "Prompt Explorer" design. A persistent navigation sidebar/topbar allows users to select from the 15 prompt titles. Clicking a title dynamically updates the main content panel with the full details of that prompt (title, scene, effects, and analyzed thematic tags). This structure was chosen to facilitate rapid Browse of ideas while allowing for an immersive deep-dive into any selected prompt without leaving the page, turning a static list into an efficient creative tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The report is text-based, so the primary 'visualization' is the information architecture itself. Key data points (themes, core elements, narrative stage) are extracted and presented as visually distinct 'tags' or 'pills' using HTML/CSS for quick comprehension. The main interaction is a JS-driven navigation that updates content blocks. Report Info: Prompt List -> Goal: Exploration -> Presentation: Interactive Nav List -> Interaction: On-click content update -> Justification: Allows quick scanning and deep dives. Report Info: Scene/Effects Text -> Goal: Inform/Inspire -> Presentation: Well-structured text blocks -> Interaction: Dynamic update -> Justification: Clear, readable presentation of core creative material. No charts are needed. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

The scene is one of peaceful intimacy, a stark contrast to the war outside.",
