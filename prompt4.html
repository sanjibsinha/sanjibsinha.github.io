    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral Future (Cream, Slate, Soft Teal Accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard design. The core is an interactive gallery of "prompt cards". Users can filter these cards by key themes (Activity, Setting) using buttons at the top. A summary bar chart visualizes the distribution of these themes, also allowing for interactive filtering. Clicking a card opens a modal with the full prompt text. This structure was chosen to transform a static list into an exploratory tool, allowing users to quickly find prompts matching specific criteria and understand the overall thematic composition of the set, which is more user-friendly than reading through all 15 linearly. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Prompt List -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Interactive Card Grid (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Filter buttons (JS) update card visibility; click card opens modal. Justification: Organizes dense text into digestible, filterable chunks. 2. Thematic Overview -> Goal: Compare/Inform -> Viz: Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Displays counts of prompts per theme; clicking a bar filters the grid. Justification: Provides a quick quantitative summary of the qualitative data. 3. Full Prompt Display -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Modal Window (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Displays full text on card click. Justification: Keeps the main interface clean while providing easy access to details. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
